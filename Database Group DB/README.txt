Created this folder for copy and paste purposes. 
Super stupid, but should work.
If you've made changes to the db structure (NOT the data) then please copy & replace the new db here.
Every time you do a pull, copy & replace your xampp db with this file

Our db can be found at:
C:\xampp\mysql\data

If you don't do this then you owe the other two members one (1) pint of alcholic beverage of their choosing.
This could be spirits.
